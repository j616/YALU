YALU: YetAnotherLevelUp -- An FVWM configuration.

YALU is a configuration for the powerful FVWM window manager that provides a
number of neat features, fully graphical configuration (and also fully
text-based configuration if you preffer), reasonable performance and less
torture than its predecessor: AnotherLevelUp.

Requirements:
	> FVWM 2.4 (or later)
	> Python 2.5 (up until Python 3)
	> Zenity
	> Feh
	> Screen
	> Dmenu
	> Xload *
	> Xclock *
	> Stalonetray *

* optional but presently will leave a big empty space if its missing

Installation:
* Put this directory in .yalu in your home folder.
* Make FVWM read fvwmConfig on startup (e.g. in your .xinitrc or by symlinking it
to a default FVWM configuration directory)
